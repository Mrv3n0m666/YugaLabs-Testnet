## You can deploy your own token on testnet and make mass transaction with your token contract address!


A simple Node.js application to interact with Ethereum testnets. This project allows you to:

- **Send Tokens** to a list of addresses with configurable amounts and delays.
- **Deploy New ERC-20 Tokens** with customizable names, symbols, and initial supply.

 ## üîçFeatures

- **Send Tokens:**
  - Choose the token contract, symbol, and decimals.
  - Specify the amount and number of transactions.
  - Set a delay between transactions.
  - Option to randomize sending amounts with configurable fluctuation.
  
- **Deploy ERC-20 Token:**
  - Provide token name, symbol, and total supply.
  - Compile and deploy the token contract on the testnet.
  - View deployment status and transaction details.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Ethereum Testnet RPC URL** - For example, Alchemy or Infura.
- **Private Key** - To interact with the testnet.
